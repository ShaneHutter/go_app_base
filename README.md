# Go App Base
## This is an experimental base template for building a Go web app that includes features I commonly use in Python/Flask applications

Features to replicate:
* Session Management
* Render Jinja into html/css/js
* G-Zip/Brotli compression
* Server side Websocket setup
* Load YAML files for app config
* Connect to DB cluster (psql)
* Connect to Redis Node/Cluster
