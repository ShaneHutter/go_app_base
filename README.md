## This is an experimental base template for building a Go web app

Features I'm looking to achieve:
* Session Management
* * Brotli compression
    * br encoding working, currently 100% content is br
* Server side Websocket setup
* Load YAML files for app config
* Connect to DB cluster (psql)
* Connect to Redis Node/Cluster
